# hello-world
This is my first coding project. I've heard its a right of passage, so here it goes!

Christian here. I'm excited to leard to code because I think there are some very interesting people to collaborate with working on cool projects. I hope to learn fast so I can start working on cool projects with all of you.

I'm making a change without committing it. Can I see this highlighted in GREEN?
